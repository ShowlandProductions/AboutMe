# Week 2 Assignment
About Me
I struggled a bit this week but I feel like I made significant progress from the first assignment
I began by inserting Bootstrap elemnts into my HTML to enable functions from Bootstrap
For my NavBar I customized a few features to my liking & removed excessive information.
For my links to work in the NavBar I had to reference other HTML link's that would take you there.
I then created a container for the About Me information to fit in
I uploaded an image of myself with an ALT description from my local computer

Portfolio
Keeping the NavBar format consistent I focused on created a jumbotron for a portfolio example.
Although I don't have any porfolio information I wanted to upload something to show my improvement from week to week.

Contact
To create a form I used Bootstrap components & altered them to my liking.
I struggled a bit to get the sizing I liked throughout the project but overall I'm happy with my progress
